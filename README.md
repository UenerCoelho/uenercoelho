- ðŸ’¬ Something about me:
    - I'm a very curious person, I like to learn, and I believe that one of the most wonderful things in life is to learn         something, I find the sensation of my brain exploding incredible. I love to talk about any topic, from the most               controversial to the funniest, so I am not offended by anything, nor by offenses :joy:.

    - I chose to become a dev due to the fact that programming does not choose gender or religion only those who know or who       do not know.

    - If you were curious about me, contact me, maybe we can work together?
