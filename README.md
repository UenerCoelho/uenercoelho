### Hi everone ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own busines, as informal job, but non dev job yet. However I am looking for a software        development job between 18:00 and 00:00 to start my career
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, TYPESCRIPT...
   - And I'm interested in learning NODE, REACT NATIVE, ANGULAR, PYTHON, C#, and as much as possible, learning       is never too much, since I want to become a fullstack dev
<!-- - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    - I'm a very curious person, I like to learn, and I believe that one of the most wonderful things in life is to learn         something, I find the sensation of my brain exploding incredible. I love to talk about any topic, from the most               controversial to the funniest, so I am not offended by anything, nor by offenses :joy:.

    - I chose to become a dev due to the fact that programming does not choose gender or religion only those who know or who       do not know.

    - If you were curious about me, contact me, maybe we can work together?
